# Configuration

Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Where the office keeps things

The office keeps its data in `~/agent-office` (`--home` or `AGENT_OFFICE_HOME` to move it) and clones projects next to it, as `~/agent-office/<owner>/<repo>`. To clone them somewhere else, like `~/Workspace`, an admin picks the **Workspace folder** in ⚙️ Settings → **🏢 Building** (or start with `--projects` or `AGENT_OFFICE_PROJECTS`). Floors you already have stay where they are, and a checkout of the same repository that's already in the new folder is used as it is. The building's map is in `~/agent-office/.agent-office/map.json`, and maps of your own go in `~/agent-office/.agent-office/maps/` (see [Maps](maps.md)). The list of floors is `~/agent-office/.agent-office/floors.json`, and each account's own Claude and GitHub sign-ins are in `~/agent-office/.agent-office/homes/<account>/` (revoking the account deletes them). Each floor keeps its workers, queue, pictures and worktrees in its own checkout's `.agent-office/`.

Already have a checkout? Pick its repository anyway: a checkout of it that's already where the workspace folder would clone it is used as it is. You can still start the office in a project, `agent-office ~/code/my-project`: that project becomes a floor, and the office keeps its data in `~/code/my-project/.agent-office` as it did before there were floors. An office that already ran in a project carries on in it when you start `agent-office` there again. An admin can take that project off the building in the elevator like any other floor.

## Command line

```
agent-office [dir] [options]

      --home <dir>        Where the office keeps its data without a [dir] (default ~/agent-office)
      --projects <dir>    Where new floors are cloned, as <dir>/<owner>/<repo> (default ~/agent-office;
                          also settable from ⚙️ Settings)
  -p, --port <n>          Port (default 4600, env PORT)
  -H, --host <addr>       Bind address (default 127.0.0.1; 0.0.0.0 lets your network in)
      --password <pw>     Office password (env AGENT_OFFICE_PASSWORD)
      --no-open           Don't open the office in your browser when it starts
      --agent <cmd>       Default agent command (default "claude")
      --agent-args <str>  Extra args for the configured agent, e.g. "--model opus"
      --dsh-profile <n>   DeepSeek Harness profile over ACP (default "acp")
      --tls-cert <file>   Serve HTTPS with this cert…
      --tls-key <file>    …and key
      --self-signed       Serve HTTPS with a generated self-signed cert
      --trust-proxy       Trust X-Forwarded-* (behind Caddy/nginx)
      --turn <url>        Add a TURN server for voice, e.g. turn:user:pass@host:3478
      --budget <usd>      Daily tracked Claude Code budget (OpenCode/Codex/Grok/Muse/DSH excluded)
      --budget-pause      ...and nobody can hire a new worker until the next day
      --max-workers <n>   Run at most n workers at once, across every floor (env AGENT_OFFICE_MAX_WORKERS)
      --webhook <url>     Post to this Slack / Discord webhook when a worker needs input or finishes
      --city <name>       Put the office in a real city: its sun and live weather (open-meteo.com)
      --weather <kind>    Pin the weather: clear, cloudy, rain, storm, snow or fog

agent-office setup [--projects <dir>] [--project <owner/repo>]... [--home <dir>]

  The first-start walkthrough again: the workspace folder, GitHub sign-in and
  repositories to clone as floors. With --projects / --project it asks nothing.
  Run it while the office is stopped.

agent-office prune [dir] [-n|--dry-run] [-f|--force]

  Removes leftover worker worktrees under .agent-office/worktrees/ and their
  office/* branches, in one floor's checkout (dir). Anything with uncommitted changes or unpushed commits is
  kept unless --force is given. A worker across several projects has worktrees of them in its
  own floor's workspace: prune each project to clear those out.

agent-office accounts [list | invite [name] [--admin] | revoke <name> | role <name> admin|member | password on|off] [-d <dir>]

  Invite, list and revoke people's own accounts, and switch the shared password
  off or on. Works while the office runs.
