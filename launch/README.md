# Launch kits

Submission and application kits for Kipdeck, our fork of Agent Office: five hackathons, four grant programs and sponsorship, with every deadline in one calendar. Written on 2026-09-30 from each program's official pages and re-checked against them on 2026-10-01. The root kits below were drafted under the old name and each says so at the top; the Colosseum and Solana kits under [chain/](chain/README.md) are the current Kipdeck versions. Rules change: re-read the official page before you submit, and fix the kit when they differ.

Agent Office is an MIT open source project by webdevcody / AgentSystemLabs. This fork is not theirs and they have not endorsed it. Every kit credits upstream and lists exactly what the fork adds; the shared wording and the facts behind it are in [disclosure.md](disclosure.md).

Each kit has the same sections in the same order: deadline, links, eligibility checklist, pre-existing code disclosure, project description (the form's fields, within their limits), judging criteria mapped to our features, demo video script with shot list and timing, and submission checklist.

## Read this first

The risks that could sink an entry, in order:

1. **The base project is someone else's, and it is new.** Upstream's first commit is 2026-09-25. Meta's Adapted division needs a project that existed before 2026-09-24, and its New division says "no pre-existing codebases", so neither fits cleanly; the others want work that is new or significantly updated during their period, and none says whether a fork of a third-party project counts. Ask each organizer in writing (task on 2026-10-01) and disclose everything regardless.
2. **Employer permission.** Colosseum's rules make you warrant that entering does not breach your employer's policies. Get Nortal's written position on outside work, IP and prizes before registering anywhere.
3. **Memberships that take time.** Meta requires Meta VR Start membership at submission time; approval time is unknown. Colosseum closes registration at the submission deadline. Apply on day one.
4. **One demo, many rules.** Vultr requires every model call through Vultr Serverless Inference; Nebius requires Token Factory and an NVIDIA open model; Meta requires hands-only. Keep a per-event configuration rather than one demo that half-fits all.
5. **Public demos run real agents.** Judges get a live office. Sandboxes, spending caps and a judge password are part of every checklist.
6. **AI-generated video.** Meta's judging notes say to show real footage that honestly represents the experience and not to lean on AI-generated video to carry the pitch. The other rules are silent on AI voiceover; every script assumes your own voice.
7. **Drafts describe the plan, and most of the plan is not built.** On 2026-10-01 only `launch/nebius-nemotron` and `launch/x402-base` work end to end; `launch/voice-mcp` has a tested MCP-over-HTTP core that the office does not serve yet; `launch/webxr-mode`, `launch/docker-sandbox`, `launch/vultr-deploy` and `launch/solana-escrow` have no commits. The status table in [disclosure.md](disclosure.md) has the details. The project descriptions and video scripts are written as if each workstream ships as planned. Before submitting, cut every claim the branch does not do yet, and fill the `{{...}}` numbers with real figures or "none yet".

## Timeline

Every dated item from 2026-09-30, generated from [deadlines.json](deadlines.json). Times are as the organizer states them, then UTC, then Vilnius. Items marked [unverified] were not published on the official pages on 2026-09-30.

<!-- timeline:end -->

## Calendar

[calendar.ics](calendar.ics) holds every item above with reminders: deadlines alert 7 days, 2 days and 6 hours before closing; tasks alert at 09:00 on the day. Import it into Google Calendar (Settings, Import and export), Outlook or Apple Calendar. Timed deadlines are stored in UTC, so they show at the right local time anywhere.

## Tools

The kits are checked by `npm test`, so a broken limit fails the build instead of a submission.

```sh
npx tsx launch/tools/calendar.ts          # regenerate calendar.ics and the timeline above from deadlines.json
npx tsx launch/tools/calendar.ts --check  # exit 1 if either is stale
npx tsx launch/tools/lint.ts              # field lengths, video timings, sections, ASCII, placeholders left to fill
npx tsx launch/tools/whats-new.ts         # the "exactly what is new" list, from git, since 226452e4 (our import of upstream 1bc3028)
```

- Change a date: edit `deadlines.json`, run `calendar.ts`, commit all three files.
- Form answers live in fences like ```` ```field name="Elevator pitch" max-chars=200 ````; the linter counts characters and words against the limit written there. `{{LIKE_THIS}}` marks what only you can fill in (fork URL, video link, real numbers).
- Video scripts start with `Runtime target: 2:45 (limit: under 3:00)`; the linter checks the shot times run from 0:00 to the target without gaps and that the target is inside the limit.
- [templates/friction-log.md](templates/friction-log.md) is the friction log for Amazon's bonus and Nebius's feedback prize.

## Consultancy pilot

The pilot offer for teams adopting coding agents is on the `launch/business-playbook` branch. The Vultr, Nebius, Colosseum and Lithuania kits refer to it as the business model; keep the numbers there and the claims here consistent.
