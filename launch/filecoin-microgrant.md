# Filecoin devgrants microgrant

Last checked: 2026-09-30. Sources: the filecoin-project/devgrants repository and its Microgrants and Builder Next Step pages (links below). fil.org/grants refused the request (HTTP 429), so the 2026 status of every program here is [unverified].

Plan: **not ready to apply.** Every Filecoin program below needs a working prototype built on Filecoin, IPFS or related technology first, and none of the fork's workstreams touch Filecoin yet. The prototype that fits Agent Office: archive a worker's session (terminal recording, the PR it opened, the meeting notes and whiteboards from the office) to IPFS and Filecoin, so a team has a verifiable, permanent record of what its agents did. Build that small prototype first, then apply.

## Deadline

- **Rolling** for Open Grants. The microgrant page's last listed focus area is "Filecoin Virtual Machine, Wave 2" with a deadline of 2023-04-20, so the microgrant track may be paused [unverified].
- Replies take 2 to 4 weeks. Work must fit in 1 to 3 months after signing.
- Internal target: prototype by 2026-11-24, apply **2026-11-25** after the Meta deadline, if the prototype exists and a program is open.

## Eligibility checklist

- [ ] Pick the program that is actually open on the day (check the repo's README and issue templates):
  - Next Step Microgrant: $5,000 paid in FIL ($1,000 up front, $4,000 after a mainnet or testnet deployment); needs a working prototype on Filecoin, IPFS, IPLD or libp2p; must fit the current focus area.
  - FIL Builder Next Step Grant: $5,000 to $10,000; needs an on-chain project on the Filecoin Virtual Machine and a proof of concept.
  - Open Grant: up to $50,000; for work that advances the Filecoin ecosystem or brings significant new usage.
- [ ] A working prototype exists (**not yet**).
- [ ] Work completable within 3 months.
- [ ] Grant-funded work open source (MIT or Apache 2.0 for code, CC-BY-SA 4.0 for content).
- [ ] Monthly progress updates as comments on the GitHub issue, and a final report.
- [ ] Payment in FIL: a Filecoin wallet; KYC and tax forms [unverified].
- [ ] Employer: Nortal's permission for outside work and for receiving grant money.

## Pre-existing code disclosure

```field name="Prior work" max-chars=800
Our prototype is part of a fork of Agent Office, an MIT open source 3D office for coding agents by webdevcody / AgentSystemLabs (github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office). The office, its workers and terminals are upstream work. Ours: the session archive that stores a worker's terminal recording, pull request and meeting notes on IPFS and Filecoin, and everything the grant would fund. Our changes against upstream: {{DIFF_URL}}
```

## Project description

The application is a GitHub issue from the program's template. The template's sections (per the program pages): a clear description of the next step, success metrics, the technical design, the problem, milestones, how the grant supports the next step, the open source commitment and the monthly updates. No length limits are published.

```field name="Next step" max-words=200
Agent Office puts a team's AI coding agents at desks in a shared 3D office. Teams now let those agents change production code, and they need a record of what each agent did that nobody can quietly edit later. Our prototype archives a finished worker session to IPFS: its terminal recording, the diff and pull request it produced, and the notes and whiteboards from the meeting where the task was assigned, bundled as a CAR file and pinned. The next step, which this grant funds, is storing those archives in Filecoin deals with retrieval from the office (click a desk's history to replay any past session), a CID written to the pull request so reviewers can verify the record, and a retention setting per team.
```

| Milestone | Deliverable | Success metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 (month 1) | Filecoin storage for session archives, CID on the PR | 100 archived sessions from 3 teams |
| M2 (month 2) | Replay from the archive in the office; retention settings | Replay of any archived session in under 10 seconds |
| M3 (month 3) | Docs, a reusable archive library, write-up | Library published; one external project using it |

## Judging criteria

| What the program asks for | Our answer |
| --- | --- |
| A working prototype | The IPFS session archive (to build first) |
| A clear next step | Filecoin deals, replay and verifiable CIDs, in 3 months |
| New usage for Filecoin | Every agent session is a new, steadily growing dataset worth keeping |
| Open source | MIT, public repo, monthly updates on the issue |

## Demo video script

The template may not ask for a video [unverified]; link a short one from the issue.

Runtime target: 1:20 (limit: under 3:00)

| Time | Shot | Voiceover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00-0:20 | A worker finishes a task at its desk | "When an agent finishes, its whole session is archived." |
| 0:20-0:45 | The CAR file, its CID, the CID on the pull request | "Terminal, diff and notes go to IPFS, and the CID goes on the PR." |
| 0:45-1:05 | Click the desk's history; the session replays from the archive | "Anyone can replay what the agent did, and verify it has not changed." |
| 1:05-1:20 | Card: next step is Filecoin storage; built on Agent Office (MIT) | "The grant takes it to Filecoin storage." |
