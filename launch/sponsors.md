# GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective

Last checked: 2026-09-30. Sources: GitHub's Sponsors setup docs and Open Source Collective's docs (links below). Anything not stated there is marked [unverified].

Plan: set up GitHub Sponsors on your personal account (bank payout), and hold off on Open Collective until the fork has enough stars or a group project needs a shared budget. Be explicit everywhere that the office itself is upstream work by webdevcody, and that sponsorship funds the fork's additions.

## Deadline

- No external deadline. Internal target: **2026-10-02**, so the profile is live before the first hackathon submission links to the repo.
- GitHub reviews a Sponsors application in "a few days".

## Links

- Set up GitHub Sponsors: https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account
- FUNDING.yml (the Sponsor button): https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository
- Open Source Collective (fiscal host): https://docs.oscollective.org/
- Open Collective fiscal hosts: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts
- Upstream author on GitHub: https://github.com/webdevcody

## Eligibility checklist

GitHub Sponsors:

- [ ] You contribute to open source (code, docs, design, mentoring all count) and live in a supported region. Lithuania is in the Stripe Connect list [unverified: check the supported regions page on the day].
- [ ] Two-factor authentication on the GitHub account.
- [ ] Payout: a bank account in the same country you live in (via Stripe Connect), or a fiscal host.
- [ ] Tax form: W-8BEN for non-US residents.
- [ ] Employer: Nortal's policy on paid side work and on donations tied to work done with company equipment or time.

Open Collective:

- [ ] Open Source Collective accepts open source projects with at least 100 GitHub stars (or equivalent); host fee 10 percent. The fork will not have 100 stars on day one.
- [ ] Alternative hosts for an EU-based project exist (for example Open Collective Europe) with their own criteria and fees [unverified].
- [ ] A collective needs a clear, shared purpose; a one-person fork is usually better served by GitHub Sponsors alone.

## Pre-existing code disclosure

Put this at the top of the Sponsors profile and in the fork's README "Sponsor" section, so no sponsor thinks they are paying the upstream author or that we wrote the office:

```field name="Sponsors profile intro" max-chars=600
I maintain a fork of Agent Office, the MIT open source 3D office for coding agents created by webdevcody (github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office). The office is his work, and if you want to support it, sponsor him too. Sponsoring me funds what the fork adds: a WebXR mode for Quest, a remote MCP server for voice assistants, sandboxed workers, cloud deploys and payments. Everything stays MIT.
```

## Project description

Profile fields: bio and introduction, up to six featured repositories, and up to 10 monthly and 10 one-time tiers (prices cannot be edited after publishing; make a new tier instead).

```field name="Short bio" max-chars=160
Building a fork of Agent Office: coding agents at desks in a shared 3D office, now in VR, by voice and in sandboxes.
```

| Tier | Price | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coffee | $5 / month | Name in the fork's README |
| Desk | $25 / month | Vote on the next feature; early builds |
| Team | $250 / month | Logo in the README; a monthly call about running agents in your team |
| One-time thanks | $20 once | Name in the release notes |

Draft `.github/FUNDING.yml` for the fork (add it on the fork's main branch, not here). Listing upstream too is a courtesy; check first whether webdevcody has a Sponsors profile [unverified]:

```yaml
github: [{{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}}]
# custom: ["https://opencollective.com/{{COLLECTIVE_SLUG}}"]
```

## Judging criteria

No judging here. What GitHub checks on review, and what sponsors look at before paying:

| Who | What they look at | Our answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub review | Eligibility, 2FA, bank and tax details complete | Checklist above |
| Open Source Collective | Open source license, 100 stars, a real community | MIT; apply later when the stars are there |
| Sponsors | Is it alive, is it honest, what does my money do | Weekly commits, clear credit to upstream, tiers tied to concrete features |

## Demo video script

Optional: GitHub profiles do not host video, but a short clip linked from the profile and the README helps.

Runtime target: 0:50 (limit: under 3:00)

| Time | Shot | Voiceover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00-0:15 | The office in VR, agents typing | "This is Agent Office, webdevcody's open source office for coding agents, in VR." |
| 0:15-0:35 | Quick cuts: Alexa asking about workers, a sandbox blocking a command | "My fork adds VR, voice and sandboxes." |
| 0:35-0:50 | Sponsors page, the tiers | "Sponsoring keeps those going, and it all stays MIT." |

## Submission checklist
