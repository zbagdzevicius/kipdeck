// "Unknown file extension .css".

// npm test loads it as #tests/css (package.json "imports"), not by a relative path: processes the
// tests start with node's own flags, like the PTY host (src/server/ptys.ts), run from another folder,
// where ./tests/support/css.mjs isn't there and they would fail to start.
