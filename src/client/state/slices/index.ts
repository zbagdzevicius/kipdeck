// Every slice of the store, the core's included, in the one order the store runs them in: the order
// they take in each message and each floor you arrive on, and so the order their topics fire in. On
// `welcome`, after the map (see map.ts), the floor's topics fire from `floor` on down, then everyone
// else's from the top; on every other message, the topics fire top to bottom. That's the order the
// office has always fired them in, so a new slice goes at the end.
//
// Each slice's module also adds its fields and topics to Store and Topics (see ../store.ts), which only
// happens for a module that's imported: here.
