// review (the list's own two sections, so the figures always match it), how long the oldest has
// waited (a clock that ticks, clock.ts), the median wait of today's reviews, and what merged today.
// A click opens Numbers, which has the last 7 days and the history behind them (shared/metrics.ts
// does the arithmetic for both).
