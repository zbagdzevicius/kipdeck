// `agent-office tunnel`, run on your own computer: every web server a worker starts in an office
// somewhere else opens on the same port here, by itself, and closes when the worker stops it. It
// asks the office which servers there are every couple of seconds (wire.ts), and listens on each
// one's port (forwarder.ts). Given an SSH address it opens the tunnel to the office too (ssh.ts).

const HELP = `agent-office tunnel: open every worker's web server on this computer, by itself

Usage:
  agent-office tunnel [where] [options] [-- <ssh options>]

Run it on your own computer and leave it running. Whenever a worker in the office
starts a web server (npm run dev, a preview build), the same port opens here:
http://localhost:5173 on this computer is the worker's localhost:5173. It closes
again when the worker stops the server. No command per server, nothing to restart.

Where the office is:
  office@203.0.113.7      An SSH address (the one Invite teammates shows, also
  ssh://office@host:2222  as ssh://, or a Host from your ssh config). Opens the
                          tunnel to the office as well, and the office in your
                          browser, and opens the tunnel again when it drops
  http://localhost:4600   An office you can already open in a browser: through a
  https://office.example  tunnel that's running, on a domain, or on your tailnet.
                          The default is http://localhost:4600

It signs in like a browser does. The first time it asks for the office password
(or your name and your own) and keeps the session for next time.

Options:
  -p, --port <n>          With an SSH address: the port the office gets on this
                          computer (default: the same as --office-port)
      --office-port <n>   With an SSH address: the office's port on its own
                          machine (default ${DEFAULT_PORT})
      --name <name>       Sign in with this account (env AGENT_OFFICE_NAME)
      --password <pw>     The password, instead of being asked for it
                          (env AGENT_OFFICE_PASSWORD)
      --no-open           With an SSH address: don't open the office in a browser
      --insecure          Accept a certificate nobody vouches for (--self-signed)
  -h, --help              Show this help

Everything after -- goes to ssh, e.g.  agent-office tunnel office@host -- -i ~/.ssh/office
