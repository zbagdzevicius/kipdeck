// The Numbers window's arithmetic: what this Kipdeck's signed shipped log says about the last two

// sat waiting on a person before its review), changes merged and sent back, agent-hours behind the
// merges, the merge rate (overall and per agent and model, always with its N) and merges per day.
// Pure, so the page and the tests use the same rules. Every number comes from records on this machine.
